    ~ What is GeThem?

      An Online-2-Offline platform powered by Flask, MySQL & Gensim.

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the config.py file or
         export an GETHEM_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. in the shell setup database using schema.sql         

      3. now you can run the gethem.py file with your
         python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/
         or 
         you can run using on tornado server with
         python torna.py and the application will 
         greet you on http://localhost:8000/
