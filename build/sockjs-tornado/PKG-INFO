Description: SockJS-tornado server
        =====================
        
        SockJS-tornado is a Python server side counterpart of `SockJS-client browser library <https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client>`_
        running on top of `Tornado <http://tornadoweb.org>`_ framework.
        
        Simplified echo SockJS server could look more or less like::
        
            from tornado import web, ioloop
            from sockjs.tornado import SockJSRouter, SockJSConnection
        
            class EchoConnection(SockJSConnection):
                def on_message(self, msg):
                    self.send(msg)
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                EchoRouter = SockJSRouter(EchoConnection, '/echo')
        
                app = web.Application(EchoRouter.urls)
                app.listen(9999)
                ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
        
        (Take look at `examples <https://github.com/MrJoes/sockjs-tornado/tree/master/examples>`_ for a complete version).

        SockJS-tornado API
        ------------------
        
        SockJS provides slightly different API than _tornado.websocket_. Main differences are:
        
        1.  Depending on transport, actual client connection might or might not be there. So, there is no _self.request_ and
            other _tornado.web.RequestHandler_ properties.
        2.  Changed _open_ callback name to _on\_open_ to be more consistent with other callbacks.
        3.  Instead of _write\_message_, all messages are sent using _send_ method. Just in case, _send_ in _tornado.web.RequestHandler_
            sends raw data over the connection, without encoding it.
        4.  There is handy _broadcast_ function, which accepts list (or iterator) of clients and message to send.
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        You can pass various settings to the _SockJSRouter_, in a dictionary::
        
            MyRouter = SockJSRouter(MyConnection, '/my', dict(disabled_transports=['websocket']))
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        sockjs-tornado properly works behind haproxy and it is recommended deployment approach.
        
        Sample configuration file can be found `here <https://raw.github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node/master/examples/haproxy.cfg>`_.
        
        If your log is full of "WARNING: Connection closed by the client", pass _no\_keep\_alive_ as _True_ to _HTTPServer_ constructor::
        
            HTTPServer(app, no_keep_alive=True).listen(port)
        
        or::
        
            app.listen(port, no_keep_alive=True)
