SockJS-tornado server
=====================

SockJS-tornado is a Python server side counterpart of `SockJS-client browser library <https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client>`_
running on top of `Tornado <http://tornadoweb.org>`_ framework.

Simplified echo SockJS server could look more or less like::

    from tornado import web, ioloop
    from sockjs.tornado import SockJSRouter, SockJSConnection

    class EchoConnection(SockJSConnection):
        def on_message(self, msg):
            self.send(msg)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        EchoRouter = SockJSRouter(EchoConnection, '/echo')

        app = web.Application(EchoRouter.urls)
        app.listen(9999)
        ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()

SockJS-tornado API
------------------

SockJS provides slightly different API than _tornado.websocket_. Main differences are:

1.  Depending on transport, actual client connection might or might not be there. So, there is no _self.request_ and
    other _tornado.web.RequestHandler_ properties.
2.  Changed _open_ callback name to _on\_open_ to be more consistent with other callbacks.
3.  Instead of _write\_message_, all messages are sent using _send_ method. Just in case, _send_ in _tornado.web.RequestHandler_
    sends raw data over the connection, without encoding it.
4.  There is handy _broadcast_ function, which accepts list (or iterator) of clients and message to send.

Settings
--------

You can pass various settings to the _SockJSRouter_, in a dictionary::

    MyRouter = SockJSRouter(MyConnection, '/my', dict(disabled_transports=['websocket']))

Deployment
----------

sockjs-tornado properly works behind haproxy and it is recommended deployment approach.

Sample configuration file can be found `here <https://raw.github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node/master/examples/haproxy.cfg>`_.

If your log is full of "WARNING: Connection closed by the client", pass _no\_keep\_alive_ as _True_ to _HTTPServer_ constructor::

    HTTPServer(app, no_keep_alive=True).listen(port)

or::

    app.listen(port, no_keep_alive=True)
